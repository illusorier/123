什么是数据结构？


Data Structure are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently.

Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way.

链表

Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure.

A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array.

Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.

Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.

A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.

栈

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.

A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages.

It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack.

A real-world stack allows operations at one end only.

This feature makes it LIFO data structure.

集合是由一组无序且唯一的项组成的

The `Set` object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object reference.

`Object` is similar to `Map` in that both let you set keys and values, 

- The keys of an `Object` are `String` and `Symbol`, whereas they can be any values for a 

Primitive data types are the most basic elements where all the other data structures are built upon.

Arrays are colloections of zero or more elements.

Arrays are one of the most used data structure because of

While JavaScript doesn't natively include a type called "Dictionary", it does contain a very flexible type called "Object".
