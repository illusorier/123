database management system (DBMS)

SQL ( Structured Query Language ) is a standard **language** for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in database.

A database most often contains one or more tables.

Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders").

Table contain records (rows) with data.

Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.

        SELECT * FROM Customers;

Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.
