In computer programming, **event-driven programming** is a programming paradigm in which the flow of 

You browser is one big infinite loop.

    while (queue.waitForMessage()) {
      queue.processNextMessage();
    }

It's waiting for you to do things all the time and, when you do, it fires off "Events" to describe what you just did.

Some events are generated by the user, like

##### Why We Need Asynchronous Behavior in the Browser

This asynchronous behavior is necessary because the kinds of events that JavaScript works with are often either time consuming (HTTP request) or highly intermittent

JavaScript is **single-threaded** yet it mimics the behavior of a multithreaded process by efficiently using its time 

The **Call Stack** contains the list of 

JavaScript has 

The *event loop* got

##### "Run-to-completion"

Each message is processed

JavaScript can only ever execute one piece of code at a time (due to its single-threaded nature). 

This means that when an asynchronous event occurs (like )
