CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS.

It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike **flexbox** which is largely a 1-dimensional system.

A grid will typically have **columns**, **rows**, and then gaps between each row and column - commonly referred to as **gutters**.
