Web Component consists of four main technology (which does not necessarily have to all be used together):


Custom Elements is a capability for creating your own custom HTML elements.

        class XProduct extends HTMLElement {
            construct() {
                super();
                
                
                
                
                
Shadow DOM provides encapsulation for DOM and CSS in a Web Component.

Shadow DOM must always be attached to an existing element.
