## HTTP access control (CORS)

A resource makes a **cross-origin HTTP request** when it requests a resource from a different domain, protocol, or port to its own.

For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from within scripts.

For example, `XMLHttpRequest` and `Fetch` follow the same-origin policy.
