#### Pixel density

The number of pixels that fit into an inch is referred to as "pixel density".

High-density screens have more pixels per inch than low-density ones.

As a result, UI elements (such as a button) appear physically larger on low-density and smaller on high-density screens.

Screen resolution refers to the total number pixels in a display.

screen density = screen width (or height) in pixels / screen width (or height) in inches

#### Density-independent pixels (dp)

"Density-independentto " refers to the uniform display of UI elements on screens with different densities.
 
### Button

Buttons communicate the action that will occur when the user touches them.

**Elevation**

Flat buttons: 0dp
Raised buttons: 2dp

There are three standard types of buttons:

- Floating action button
- Raised button
- Flat button: A button made of ink that displays ink reaction on press but does not lift.
