What is a Function?
A function is a process which takes some input,called arguments,and produces some output called a return value.Functions may serve the following purposes:
1. Mapping: Produce some output based on given inputs. A function maps input values to output values.
2. Procedures: 
3. I/O

### Mapping
Pure functions are all about mapping.Functions map input arguments to return values,meaning that for each set of inputs,there exists an output.



### Pure Functions
A pure function is a function which:
1. Given the same input,will always return the same output.
2. Produces no side effects.
3. Relies on no external mutable state.
