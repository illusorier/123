The purpose of a service is to provide a window to its clients so that they can access these resources.

In general, RESTful services should have following properties and features.

- Representation
- Messages


A resource can easily be thought of as an object as in OOP.

For example, depending on your requirement, you can decide to use JSON or XML.

XML can be used to represent more complex resources.

REST requires each resource to have at least one URI.
