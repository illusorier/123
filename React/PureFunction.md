#### What is a Function?


Functions may serve the following purposes:

1. Mapping: Produce some output based on given inputs. A function maps input values to output values.
2. eProcedures: 
3. I/O

#### Mapping

Pure functions are all about mapping.

Functions map input arguments to return values, meaning that for each set of inputs, there exists an output.

####  Pure Functions

A **pure function** is a function which:

- Given the same input, will always return the same output.
-  Produces no side effects.


A pure function produces no side effects, which means that it can't alter any external state.
